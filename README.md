Bisection search is an upgrade in logarithmic algorthim for efficiency for searching over exhaustive enumeration, able to find numbers in the tens of iteration as opposed to tens of thousands, depending on the episilon used. 

"In mathematics, the bisection method is a root-finding method that applies to any continuous functions for which one knows two values with opposite signs. The method consists of repeatedly bisecting the interval defined by these values and then selecting the subinterval in which the function changes sign, and therefore must contain a root. It is a very simple and robust method, but it is also relatively slow. Because of this, it is often used to obtain a rough approximation to a solution which is then used as a starting point for more rapidly converging methods.The method is also called the interval halving method, the binary search method, or the dichotomy method"
